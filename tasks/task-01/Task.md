# Self Reflection

- **What does AI-Driven Development mean to you?**  
AI-Driven Development (AIDD) is new methodology building software, website or tool with AI Agent & Tools as your pair programmer. You can use it every phase of your application development like testing, debugging, deployment & maintenance. You just become an architecture and describe each and every functions/components specification in detail and let AI build it for. Sip a coffee and watch it build according to your specifications. 

- **How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?**  
I see the future as AI will do most of the work (with limitations for sure) and faster than humans. The Human will be a Strategic Architecture, directing the AI how to work with prompting and specifying the tasks.

The 2025 Turning Point proved that coding is no longer just syntax;
it’s about reasoning, collaboration, and strategy.”# Markdown syntax guide
